## Some notes about the tools

### Generated project structure
Regarding STM32 Cube Mx Sorftware, this is the basic structure of the source code generated:

* Core: main source code
    * Inc 
    * Src
    * Startup
* Drivers: HAL

Some projects files in json format: 
* .cproject: eclipse configuration with paths and files, linker configuration, etc.
* .mxproject: configuration and output paths used in for the specific cube mx project
* .project: cube ide config?
* poc_uart.ioc: stm32 cube mx project (I think this is the essentianl). All the values selected by the user in the tool.

### What to include in the gitignore:

> From the project
```
*/Core/Startup/*
*/Drivers/*
```

> From Core/Inc:
```
    stm32_assert.h: autogenerated
    #stm32l5xx_hal_conf.h: I've kept it becase is an easy way to see what modules have been included with the tool.
```

> From Core/Src:
```
    system_stm32l5xx.c
    syscalls.c
    sysmem.c
```
